The MemeMe app allows the user to take a picture, if using a device with a camera, or select an image from the camera roll, add text to the top and bottom, and share the custom meme via social media.  The user may see memes sent since starting the App in a table view or a grid view. It was created as part of Udacity's iOS nano-degree program.
